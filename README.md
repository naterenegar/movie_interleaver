# Shot Boundary Detector & Video Splicing
Shot Boundary Detector for splitting video files into cuts. Eventually, this will be benchmarked using the [MSU SBD Benchmark](http://videoprocessing.ml/benchmarks/sbd.html), just for giggles. 

## Purpose
The main purpose for this tool is to take multiple video files, detect the cuts, then interleave cuts occurring near the same time randomly. An alternative name is the **transformers transformer**, since the original use was for interleaving all six of the transformer movies.
